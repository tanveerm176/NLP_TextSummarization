Text summarization is a critical task in natural language processing, with two primary methods: abstractive and extractive summarization. This project explores the differences between these approaches by leveraging the PEGASUS and BERTSUM pre-trained models and evaluating their effectiveness using various metrics. The research focuses on summarizing long documents and investigates the performance of abstractive, extractive, and hybrid methods. The project utilizes datasets from CNN/DailyMail news articles and WikiHow instructional guides. A baseline model, selecting the first few sentences as the summary, is established for comparison. Results show that the baseline performs well due to the salient information being presented early in these domains, but caution is needed when generalizing to other contexts. Future work involves testing in different domains and on longer texts to enhance method effectiveness.
